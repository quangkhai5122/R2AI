"""Answer-unit normalisation.

CONFIRMED BY THE ORGANIZERS: `answer` must be expressed in the unit the QUESTION
asks for. For "... là bao nhiêu phần trăm?" the correct answer is 90, not 0.9.

Two distinct cases must not be confused:

  A) the source cell already holds a percentage    -> value 90   , keep 90
  B) the source cell holds a ratio (0..1)          -> value 0.9  , emit 90

We cannot tell A from B from the number alone (0.9% is a legal percentage), so
the decision uses the SOURCE CELL's context:
  - label/col_name containing '%' or 'ty le'/'phan tram' -> already a percentage
  - a value > 1.5 for a percent question                 -> already a percentage
  - otherwise a bare ratio in [0, 1.5]                   -> multiply by 100

`check_answer_unit` never rewrites silently at submission time; it reports so a
human can audit. `percent_from_cell` is used by the deterministic rule path
where the provenance of the number is known exactly.
